I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon AWS, working in the Bedrock Core Science team. I was a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s Data Mining Group ([DMG](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/)) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science and B.S. with a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics also at UIUC. My research interests lie in text mining, especially for mining structured knowledge from unstructured text data with minimal supervision.
